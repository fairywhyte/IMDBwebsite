            <p>While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule, it might have opened up slightly given the recent
                revelation that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director’s next picture is expected to be the
                hitman tale “The Irishman,” which will reteam him with his longtime friend Robert De Niro, but according
                to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Rogue One: </p>
            <p>A Star Wars Story, simply known as Rogue One, is a 2016 film directed by Gareth Edwards and produced by Lucasfilm
                president Kathleen Kennedy, amongst many others. The screenplay, written by Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy,
                is based on a story by John Knoll and Gary Whitta. The film's score is composed by Michael Giacchino, marking
                the first live-action film in the Star Wars canon to not be scored by John Williams. It is the first film
                in the Star Wars Anthology Series.</p>
            <p>Rogue One stars Felicity Jones, Diego Luna, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, Jiang Wen, Forest Whitaker,
                Mads Mikkelsen, and Alan Tudyk. Genevieve O'Reilly reprises her role as Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebel
                Alliance; O'Reilly portrayed the character for 2005's Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, but her
                scenes were cut. The film also features Darth Vader.The film, which began production in August 2015, is set
                between Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. It is set closer to the latter film and
                focuses on the formation of the Rebel Alliance and their efforts to steal the plans to the Death Star, an
                event that was referenced in the opening crawl of A New Hope. Jyn Erso, played by Jones, and a group of other
                characters band together to steal the plans from the Galactic Empire. Edwards has described the film as a
                grounded, war-based movie, one in which normal people have to come together to fight the Empire as opposed
                to relying on the Jedi or the Force.</p>
