            <h2>Zoe Saldana Joins the Voice Cast of ‘My Little Pony: The Movie’</h2>
            <p>Hasbro and Lionsgate have signed Zoe Saldana for the voice cast of the animated “My Little Pony: The Movie,”
                Variety has learned exclusively. Previously announced voice cast members include Sia, Liev Schreiber, Taye
                Diggs, Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Michael Pena. Lionsgate is releasing “My Little Pony”
                on Oct. 6, 2017.</br>
                Jayson Thiessen is directing from a screenplay by Meghan McCarthy, writer and producer of the “My Little Pony: Friendship
                Is Magic” animated series.</p>

            <h2>Jamie Foxx Still Claiming Martin Scorsese Will Direct A Mike Tyson Biopic</h2>
            <p>While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule, it might have opened up slightly given the recent
                revelation that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director’s next picture is expected to be the
                hitman tale “The Irishman,” which will reteam him with his longtime friend Robert De Niro, but according
                to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.</p>
