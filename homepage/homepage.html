            <p>While Martin Scorsese always seems to have a busy schedule, it might have opened up slightly given the recent
                revelation that he bailed on that Frank Sinatra biopic. The director’s next picture is expected to be the
                hitman tale “The Irishman,” which will reteam him with his longtime friend Robert De Niro, but according
                to Jamie Foxx, Scorsese is still going to make a Mike Tyson biopic.</p>
