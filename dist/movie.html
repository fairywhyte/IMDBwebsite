        <b>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</b>
    </p>
    <p>Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before.It was frightening, tense, very
        dark,VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto
        her face. And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!).</p>
    <p>Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely felt like a Star Wars movie should feel.Lots of
        familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful. </p>
    <p>I was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again
        Thursday night! </p>
    <p>There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been
        filled now.</p>
    <p>Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie
        managed to achieve what the other one couldn't.</p>
    <p>I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other
        die-hard SW fans.
        <p>Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could wish
            for. </p>
        <p>Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling.>Fits into the story line quite well,
            CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely.</p>
        <p>Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.</p>
