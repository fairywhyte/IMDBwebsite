        <h2>Name:</h2>
        <p>Zhen Zidan</p>
        <h2>Date of Birth:</h2>
        <p>July 27, 1963</p>
        <h2>Biography:</h2>

        <p>Donnie Yen was born in Guangzhou, China. His mother, Bow-sim Mark, was a kung fu master and his father, Kylster Yen,
            a newspaper editor and amateur musician. When Donnie was just two years old, the family moved to Hong Kong and
            then, when he was 11, to Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

        <p>There, Master Bow-sim Mark became a pioneer for Chinese martial arts in America, and it was only natural that her
            only son was trained from early childhood in the same skills. At the same time, Donnie was influenced by his
            parents' love of music and reached a high level of proficiency as a pianist. All these interests would have a
            manifest influence on Yen's later life.</p>

        <p>In his teens, Donnie defined his own persona by rebelling against his parents edicts. Beyond the limitations of his
            mother's school, Yen began training in various different fighting arts, including Japanese karate, Korean taekwondo
            and western boxing. Donnie also took up hip-hop and break-dancing. At the same time, he began spending his nights
            in Boston's notorious Combat Zone. Given that he was by now a serious practitioner of modern Wu Shu, his parents
            decided to send him to Beijing to train at the Chinese capital's famed Wu Shu academy.</p>

        <p>It was when Yen returned to Hong Kong en route back to Boston that he met the famed martial arts movie director Yuen
            Woo-ping.</p>
