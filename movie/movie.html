    <h2>Reviews:</h2>

    <p>Quick, spoiler-less thoughts from Hollywood Premiere Attendee</p>

    <p>Rogue One was quite awesome, and quite different from the movies that came before. It was frightening, tense, very dark,
        VERY dirty (literally: maybe Mon Mothma was the only character without a layer of filth make-upped onto her face.
        And she looked so much like Mothma from ROTJ!) Some differences were somewhat striking, but overall it absolutely
        felt like a Star Wars movie should feel. Lots of familiar faces to see, super tense and exciting and beautiful. I
        was SO fortunate to be able to attend the premiere at the Pantages Saturday night, and can't wait to see it again
        Thursday night! There's never been a better time to be a Star Wars fan!</p>


    <p>I feel like the void left in my heart by episode VII has been filled now.</p>

    <p>Maybe it's because I had higher expectations for episode VII and almost none for this one, I feel like this movie managed
        to achieve what the other one couldn't.</p>
    <p>I'm not saying that it was perfect, but it sure was good enough for me, and it will be good enough for many other die-hard
        SW fans. Leading female actor wasn't that good in my opinion, but otherwise this movie had everything a SW fan could
        wish for. Good old characters, good old places, and an overall good old SW feeling. Fits into the story line quite
        well, CGI was a bold move , could've gone bad, but it played out quite nicely.</p>
    <p>Overall I think SW fans will love it, but anybody not deeply immersed in the saga would also enjoy it.</p>
